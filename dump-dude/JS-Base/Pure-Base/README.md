###  Data Structures Points are going to covered:
-  Linked List (80 Hr)
    - Memory allocation is dynamic.
    - Insertion and deletion is easy.
    - Searchig is difficult.
    1. Single Link List (40 Hr)
        -  Create  link list
        -  Insert item at begining
        -  Insert item at end
        -  Insert item before specific item
        -  Insert item after specific item
        -  Reverse of list
        -  Reverse of list using recurssion
        -  Find element from link list
        -  Count of link list
        -  Delete first item from list
        -  Delete last item from list
        -  Delete specific item
        -  Make a list empty
        -  Display List
        -  Check list is empty or not
        -  Check list is full, as it allocate memory dynamic **it will never become full**.
    2. Doubly Link List (20 Hr)
        - Create List
        - Insert Before
        - Insert After
        - Insert Begining
        - Insert End
    3. Circular Link List (20 Hr)
        - Last Node of list will point to start of List
        - Start will havre refrence of last node.
-  Stack (10 Hr) **LIFO(Last In First Out) **
    - Insert & Deletion will take place Only at End
    - Need to change mermoy allocation and deallocation
    - Searchig is difficult.
    1. Static Stack
        - Push : To Insert element for Stack
        - Peek : To Get Item
        - Pop - To remove last Item from List
    2. Dynamic Stack
-  Queue (10 Hr) **FIFO(First In First Out) **
    - Insert & Deletion will take place Only at Front
    - Need to change mermoy allocation and deallocation
    - Searchig is difficult.
    1.  Static Queue
-  Hash Table (20 Hr)
-  Heap (20 Hr)
-  Priority Queue (20 Hr)
-  Trie (20 Hr)
-  Tree (Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree) (60 Hr)
-  Graph (both directed and undirected) (80 Hr)
-  Disjoint Set (60 Hr)
